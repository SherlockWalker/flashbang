# flashbang
A Python program that flashbangs you. Created 25/10/2025. Currently in development. 

## How to use:
Download the folder into a machine. Run the flashbang program.

You may want to change the code inside so that the files delete themselves after the flashbang. There are comments inside the code that can guide you (I'm not allergic to documentation).

Additionally, I've just realised that maybe I need to make this thing do 'pip install pyautogui numpy' on the target's device, because not everyone is a Python developer. I'll revise that later.
