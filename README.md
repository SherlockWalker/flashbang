# flashbang
A Python program that flashbangs you. Created 25/10/2025. Currently in development. 

## How to use:
Download the folder into a machine. Run the flashbang program.

You may want to change the code inside so that the files delete themselves after the flashbang. There are comments inside the code that can guide you (I'm not allergic to documentation).

Additionally, I've just realised that maybe I need to make this thing do 'pip install pyautogui numpy' on the target's device, because not everyone is a Python developer. I'll revise that later.


## Future goals for the project
- Make this a little more user-friendly => Tkinter interface where you can set the flashbang parameters instead of having to go into the code
- Instead of flashbang white screen, flashbang with an image instead
- Package files into .exe, which will make it a lot easier for it to delete itself
